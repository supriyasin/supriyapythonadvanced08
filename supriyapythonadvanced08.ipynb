    "  Python throws errors and exceptions when the code goes wrong, which may cause the program to stop abruptly. Python also \n",
    "  provides an exception handling method with the help of try-except. Some of the standard exceptions which are most frequent \n",
    "  include IndexError, ImportError, IOError, ZeroDivisionError, TypeError, and FileNotFoundError.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  User-Defined Exception in Python:-\n",
    "\n",
    "  Exceptions need to be derived from the Exception class, either directly or indirectly. Although not mandatory, most of the \n",
    "  exceptions are named as names that end in “Error” similar to the naming of the standard exceptions in python. For example,\n",
    "  \n",
    "  # A python program to create user-defined exception\n",
    "# class MyError is derived from super class Exception\n",
    "class MyError(Exception):\n",

    "#Q2. How are class-based exceptions that have been raised matched to handlers?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"Class-based exception handling is based on exception classes. Exception classes can be defined by the user with the \n",
    "   Exception Builder in the ABAP Workbench. A series of predefined exception classes is also available. In an exception \n",
    "   situation, an exception is represented by an exception object, in other words, by an instance of an exception class. \n",
    "   The attributes of an exception object may contain information on the error situation. All exception classes are part \n",
    "   of an inheritance hierarchy with a common superclass, CX_ROOT.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   The use of class-based exceptions is not restricted to ABAP Objects. On the contrary, class-based exceptions are designed \n",
    "   to replace the previous concepts . Class-based exceptions can, therefore, be raised and handled in all ABAP contexts \n",
    "   (programs, processing blocks). In particular, all the previous catchable runtime errors can be handled as class-based \n",
    "   exceptions.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Class-based exceptions are either raised by the ABAP statement RAISE EXCEPTION or by the ABAP runtime environment. If a \n",
    "   class-based exception occurs, the system interrupts the normal program flow and tries to find a suitable handler. If it \n",
    "   does not find a handler, a runtime error occurs.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Handlers are not only defined for the statements within a program but are defined for entire call sequences. Exceptions \n",
    "   that are raised in procedures but are not handled in the procedure itself are forwarded to the caller. The caller can either\n",
    "   handle the exception or forward it. To ensure that the caller of a procedure knows which exceptions may occur in a procedure,\n",
    "   all the unhandled exceptions of the procedure must usually be listed in their interface after the RAISING interface \n",
    "   parameter. This rule can be circumvented using specific exception classes.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Handlers are defined for one or more exception classes. To define handlers for all the subordinate classes of the \n",
    "   exception classes, a superclass is specified. This enables entire groups of related exceptions to be handled.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   Grouping self-defined and predefined exceptions on the basis of exception classes provides users with the option of raising \n",
    "   all the exceptions themselves. It also offers the advantage of consistent error handling throughout the entire program flow.\n",
    "   The ABAP syntax for class-based exceptions results in a clear distinction between normal program processing and error\n",
    "   handling. The syntax check supports the programming of the exception handling as far as possible by identifying exceptions \n",
    "   that have not been handled or forwarded.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q3. Describe two methods for attaching context information to exception artefacts.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"When it comes to attaching context information to exception artifacts, there are several methods that can be employed. \n",
    "   Here are two commonly used approaches:\n",
    "   \n",
    "  1. Exception Wrapping/Chaining:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  This method involves wrapping or chaining exceptions to preserve and propagate contextual information as exceptions are \n",
    "  passed up the call stack. It allows for capturing and encapsulating multiple levels of context related to the exception. \n",
    "  Here's how it works:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    . When an exception occurs at a lower level of the call stack, the exception handler can catch the exception, enrich it \n",
    "      with additional context information (such as stack traces, error messages, relevant variable values), and create a new \n",
    "      exception object.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . The new exception object can then be thrown, while maintaining a reference to the original exception as the cause. This \n",
    "      linking of exceptions forms a chain, allowing for easy traversal and retrieval of contextual information at various\n",
    "      levels.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "    . As the exception travels up the call stack, each layer can add its own context by wrapping the exception in a new \n",
    "      exception with additional information. This process can continue until the exception reaches the top-level handler, \n",
    "      which can then log or handle the exception appropriately.  \n",
    "    \n",
    "  Exception wrapping/chaining provides a hierarchical structure that preserves context information and helps in diagnosing \n",
    "  the root cause of an exception.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  2. Custom Exception Classes:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Another method is to define custom exception classes that include specific fields or properties for storing contextual \n",
    "  information. By extending the base exception class provided by the programming language, developers can create their own\n",
    "  exception hierarchy with additional properties to hold relevant data. Here's how it can be done:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    . Identify the specific context information that needs to be associated with the exception. It could be information \n",
    "      like timestamps, request IDs, user IDs, or any other relevant data points.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . Create a custom exception class that inherits from the base exception class. Add properties or fields to the custom\n",
    "      class to store the required contextual information.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . When an exception occurs, create an instance of the custom exception class, populate the additional context fields, \n",
    "      and throw the custom exception. This way, the contextual information is directly embedded within the exception object\n",
    "      itself.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . Exception handlers can then catch the custom exception and extract the relevant information from the added properties. \n",
    "      This allows for easy access to context-specific details when analyzing or handling the exception. \n",
    "      \n",
    "   Custom exception classes provide a structured and explicit way of attaching context information to exceptions, making it \n",
    "   clear what kind of data should be associated with each exception and facilitating the extraction of that information when \n",
    "   needed.  \n",
    "   \n",
    " Both of these methods aim to enhance the diagnostic capabilities of exceptions by capturing and preserving contextual \n",
    " information related to the occurrence of an exception, thus aiding in troubleshooting and debugging efforts. The choice\n",
    " between these methods depends on the programming language, framework, and specific requirements of the application or system \n",
    " being developed.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q4. Describe two methods for specifying the text of an exception object&#39;s error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"When it comes to specifying the text of an exception object's error message, there are various methods that can be \n",
    "   utilized. Here are two common approaches:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   1. String Interpolation:\n",
    "   \n",
    "     One method for specifying the text of an exception object's error message is through string interpolation. String \n",
    "     interpolation allows you to dynamically insert values or variables into a string template. Here's how it works:\n",
    "     \n",
    "     . Identify the information that needs to be included in the error message, such as variable values, error codes,\n",
    "       or contextual details.\n",
    "       \n",
    "     . Create a string template that includes placeholders for the dynamic values. These placeholders are typically marked \n",
    "       with special syntax, such as {} or ${} depending on the programming language. \n",
    "       \n",
    "     . At the point where the exception is thrown, populate the placeholders in the string template with the actual values. \n",
    "       This can be done by referencing the variables or values within the exception message construction. \n",
    "       \n",
    "     . Throw the exception object with the error message as the constructed string. The placeholders will be replaced with\n",
    "       the respective values at runtime.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    Using string interpolation allows for flexible and expressive error messages that can include specific details based on \n",
    "    the current state of the program. It provides a straightforward way to inject variable values into the error message,\n",
    "    making it more informative and contextual.\n",
    "    \n",
    "  2. External Resource Files:\n",
    "  \n",
    "    Another method is to specify the error message text through external resource files. Instead of hardcoding the error \n",
    "    message within the code itself, the error messages are stored in separate files that can be easily maintained and \n",
    "    localized. Here's how it can be implemented:  \n",
    "    \n",
    "    . Create one or more resource files (e.g., .properties, .xml, .json) dedicated to storing error messages. Each error \n",
    "      message can be associated with a unique identifier or key.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . Define the error messages in the resource files, providing the appropriate text for each exception scenario. \n",
    "      The messages can include placeholders for dynamic values, similar to the string interpolation method.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . In the code, when an exception occurs, construct the exception object with an error code or identifier that corresponds\n",
    "      to the desired error message in the resource file.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    . Implement a mechanism to retrieve the error message based on the error code or identifier. This can involve reading \n",
    "      the resource file and extracting the specific message associated with the provided code.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "    By externalizing the error messages, you can separate them from the code logic, making it easier to manage and modify\n",
    "    the messages without modifying the code itself. It also enables localization and internationalization efforts by allowing\n",
    "    different versions of the resource files for different languages or regions.\n",
    "    \n",
    " Both of these methods provide flexibility and maintainability when specifying the text of an exception object's error message.\n",
    " The choice between them depends on factors such as the complexity of the error messages, the need for localization, and the \n",
    " preferred approach within the programming language or framework being used.\"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#Q5. Why do you no longer use string-based exceptions?\n",
    "\n",
    "\"\"\"As an AI language model, I don't have personal preferences or choices. However, I can provide information on why \n",
    "   string-based exceptions are not commonly used in modern programming practices.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In older programming languages, such as C and early versions of C++, exception handling mechanisms were not well-defined\n",
    "   or standardized. As a result, programmers often used strings to represent and communicate error or exception information. \n",
    "   For example, a function might return a string indicating the reason for failure or throw a string-based exception when \n",
    "   encountering an error.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   However, using string-based exceptions has several drawbacks compared to using structured exception types or classes, \n",
    "   which are commonly used in modern programming languages:\n",
    "   \n",
    "    1. Lack of Type Safety: Strings are inherently untyped, which means it's difficult to enforce consistent handling of \n",
    "       exceptions. Developers may accidentally catch or ignore exceptions they shouldn't or fail to catch specific exceptions \n",
    "       they expect.\n",
    "       \n",
    "    2. Limited Information: Strings alone may not provide sufficient information about the exception. Structured exception \n",
    "       types, on the other hand, can include additional fields or properties to convey more detailed information about the \n",
    "       error, such as error codes, stack traces, or inner exceptions. \n",
    "       \n",
    "    3. Limited Handling Options: With string-based exceptions, the only straightforward way to handle exceptions is by \n",
    "       comparing their string values. This approach lacks flexibility and can lead to brittle code. In contrast, structured \n",
    "       exceptions allow for more granular exception handling, such as catching specific exception types or using inheritance \n",
    "       to handle related exceptions together.  \n",
    "       \n",
    "    4. Localization and Internationalization: String-based exceptions make it challenging to support localization or \n",
    "       internationalization efforts because the error messages are embedded directly in the code. Using structured exceptions \n",
    "       allows for separating the error messages from the code, enabling easier translation and adaptation to different \n",
    "       languages or locales. \n",
    "       \n",
    "  Modern programming languages, including Java, C#, Python, and others, provide built-in mechanisms for defining and handling \n",
    "  structured exceptions. These languages promote the use of exception classes or types, which offer better type safety, \n",
    "  improved error information, and more flexible exception handling capabilities compared to string-based exceptions.\"\"\""
